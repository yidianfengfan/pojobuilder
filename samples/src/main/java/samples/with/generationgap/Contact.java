/**
 * This is a demonstration of the "generation gap" feature.
 * <p>
 * "One of the difficulties of code generation is that generated code and handwritten code need to be treated
 * differently. Generated code should never be edited by hand, otherwise you can't safely regenerate it.
 * 
 * Generation Gap is about keeping the generated and handwritten parts separate by putting them in different classes
 * linked by inheritance. " (Martin Fowler, http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/generationGap.html)
 * </p>
 * 
 * The PojoBuilder will generate two classes if you set the "withGenerationGap" directive to "true".
 * <ul>
 * <li>The "AbstractContactBuilder" contains the generated code and souldn't be modified.</li>
 * <li>The "ContactBuilder" is an extension of the abstract builder and can be modified manually. To prevent this class
 * from being overwritten please move it out of the generated-sources folder.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
